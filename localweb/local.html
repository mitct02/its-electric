            <b>NOTE:</b>
            Starting April 8 I am measuring only one hot water heater on each panel,
            rather than the electric usage of the whole house.
            This is so I can measure the impact of our solar thermal system
            which will be coming online soon, we hope!  Scroll back past April 8
            to see more typical graphs.
        </p>

            <b>Our electric usage:</b> 
            This graph shows the electric usage of Hypatia House, a home in suburban 
            <a href="http://www.charlottesville.org">Charlottesville VA</a> shared by
            <a href="http://tupelo-schneck.org">the Tupelo-Schneck family</a> and 
            the Downey/Rohdie family (of <a href="http://carpedonut.argon.org">Carpe Donut</a> fame).
            You can zoom in, and the graph will automatically reload at a higher
            resolution; you may have to be patient since we're serving this from home.
            The two lines correspond to two different electric panels in the house.
            You may notice gaps in the data (debugging, power outages) and wonkiness on MTU1 (the dreaded
            Line Noise; mostly solved by removing a couple of compact fluorescents, sadly).
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <b>The software:</b>
            The data comes from a <a href="http://www.theenergydetective.com">TED 5000</a> home energy
            monitoring system, and is presented using Robert's <span class="monospace">it's electric</span>
            software.  <span class="monospace">it's electric</span> runs on the home network, polling
            the TED 5000 for second-by-second data and storing it in a database, along with averages over
            longer time spans; it runs a server which provides the data according to 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/">the Google Visualization API</a>; and it
            includes this webpage to display the data interactively at various levels of resolution.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Run your own:</b>
            Anyone with a TED 5000 who can run Java and a web server can
            <a href="its-electric-1.4.2.zip">download <span class="monospace">it's electric</span></a>
            and use it to store and view their own energy data, either for personal use or
            to share over the Web.  Alternate downloads are 
            <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/its-electric-software/web/its-electric-1.4.2.zip">from our the Google Group's files</a> or
            <a href="http://its-electric.googlecode.com/files/its-electric-1.4.2.zip">from our Google Code files.</a>
            Also note some installation advice from users available from <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/its-electric-software">the Google Group welcome page</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Discussion group:</b>
            I have created a Google Group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/its-electric-software">its-electric-software</a>
            for discussion, submission of bug reports and feature requests,
            publicizing your own <span class="monospace">it's electric</span>
            sites, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Developers wanted:</b>
            I have created an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/its-electric/"><span class="monospace">it's electric</span> project at Google Code</a>
            and would be delighted to have contributions from other developers.
