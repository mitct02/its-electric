Remember I have a TODO file

blocking actions on ATL while not ready?
fix up allowRedraw with larger resolutions...
fix up allowRedraw with servlet not sending point at maximum
problem if atl2 has allowRedraw:true and atl1 is realtime



Check multi-browser

Debug big-blue-bar effect on timeline
Change servlet boundary-adding code to include points from all MTUs...?

Don't have "Show voltage" when voltage is not available.

There is potential loss of data if its-electric crashes abruptly during a catchup---
not loss of seconds data, but bad averaging.  Current solution is a hack,
but then again it's not much of a problem...

Trim data
MTU math
